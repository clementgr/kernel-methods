# Kernel Methods
Data challenge: predicting whether a DNA sequence region is binding site to a specific transcription factor

# How to reproduce results?
To reproduce the model that gave my best score on the academic leaderboard, just run:
* `git clone https://github.com/clementgr/kernel-methods.git`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python -m main.py --config config/best_submission.json` 

Other config files allow to run different models
